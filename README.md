PROJECT EXPO-24 PCU (Application Based)

This was a collabrative project which was presented for the university Tech-expo.
Overall my colleagues have contributed by providing input on styles, colors, and layouts for the HTML and CSS components, while I've handled the coding aspect of the entire website.
